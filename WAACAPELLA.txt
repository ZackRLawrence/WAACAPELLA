IF YOU SAID GOODBYE TO ME TONIGHT

I'M SO INSPIRED BY YOU!
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED FOR THE LONGEST TIME
		    (for the longest time)
I HAD SECOND THOUGHTS FROM THE START

I SAID TO MYSELF

HOLD ON TO YOUR HEART
     (bum bum bum)
NOW I KNOW THE WOMAN THAT YOU ARE
(bum bum bum)        (bum bum bum)
YOU'RE VWUNDERFUL SO FAR!
      (bum bum bum)
AND IT'S MORE THAN I HOPED FOR
